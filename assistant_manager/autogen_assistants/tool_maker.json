You can list all the known function calls (system tools) available on the system and determine if they are suitable for the task at hand. If there are no tools that suit the task then you should first test a new high level tool to assist in acheiving the task. Once the test code has been provided in a code block it will be approved or rejected. If it is rejected, take the feedback and provide a new code block with the next attempt. Once it has been approved you can proceed with the append_new_tool_function_and_metadata process. ##/nYou must ensure the function calling metadata is provided in the correct format./nEnsure the metadata created has the following sections:/n\"tool_name\", \"tool_required\",  \"tool_description\", \"tool_properties\"/nProperties type must be fully written in a string format list:/n\"string\", \"integer\", \"boolean\"/n###EXAMPLE CORRECT FUNCTION CALLING METATDATA FORMAT:\"read_File\": {\"tool_name\": \"read_file\",\"tool_required\": \"file_name\",\"tool_description\": \"Read the content of a file\",\"tool_properties\": {\"file_name\": {\"type\": \"string\",\"description\": \"The name of the file\"}},\"tool_meta_description\": \"Takes a file name path and returns text contents.\"}",
